# MandelBrot-Generator

This is an assignment from my Concurrent Programming course at Drexel.

This repository is for portfolio purposes only.

The program is designed to generate a snapshots of the mandelbrot set in an efficient manner by splitting up the generation of pixels using concurrency. 

The program takes five parameters:
./{program_name} {x1} {x2} {y1} {y2} {filename}

Where x1 and x2 are the x range of the mandelbrot set, and y1 and y2 are the y range of the mandelbrot set generated by the program.

Filename is the name of the picture to be stored once created. 

If you wish to run the program, you first need to git clone the repository, and load up the repository onto an IDE of your choice. I use VSCode.

You can then type "make" in the command line of the repository which will generated the compiled C++ code file for you to run. 

To make your life easier, the makefile has 5 different snapshots you can make by typing "make" followed by any of these keywords:

e0.bmp, e1.bmp, e2.bmp, e3.bmp, e4.bmp

Here are the snapshots created for each of these commands:
